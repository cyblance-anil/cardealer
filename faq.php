                        <p>Not everyone needs in-home skilled medical care. This creates a valuable niche for non-medical home care providers that can help seniors remain independent through companion and personal care services, such as basic help around the house, transportation to appointments, reminders to take medication, and assistance with eating and bathing. And due to lower labor and insurance costs, profit margins for non-medical care businesses can be just as good— or even better—than for medical home care companies.</p>
